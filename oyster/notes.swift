/* 
 - I need to pass the student photo variables from the table view row to the student detail page by connecting them to the selectedphoto variable. This will allow us to only pull the data from the server once and pass it to everywhere throguh the app.
 
 -I would like to use collections views for the behavior counting buttons on the student detail page. It would be optimal to be able to have more than one set of tracked behaviors that could be scrolled through with each set as a beahvior. how can we designate mutlipel sets of targets and replacement behaviors for a student. I.E. Timmy is being tracked for two different sets of behaviors. Blurting vs. raising hands & crying vs. asking for a break.
